def craft_generate_prompt(inputs, problem, solution):
    prompt = f"""You are tasked with solving a programming problem by predicting the output of a given canonical solution based on specified inputs. Follow these steps to ensure the accuracy and clarity of your answer:
1. Understand the Problem: Carefully read the programming problem and what the code is intended to solve.
2. Analyze the Code: Break down the provided canonical solution into several necessary logical parts to understand each componentâ€™s role in achieving the solution.
3. Simulate the Code Execution: Reason the code with the given inputs, carefully tracing the values and operations to understand how the output is derived.
4. Document Each Step: Clearly describe your thoughts  and the reasoning behind each code execution step, including any intermediate results that lead to the final output.
5. Present the Final Output: Combining all insights to determine the final result after thoroughly reasoning through and simulating the code.
Each step of your reasoning SHOULD BE well-documented, providing a clear explanation of your thought process and any intermediate results.
The final output of the program, after executing with the given inputs, should be presented and enclosed within [Output] and [/Output] tags. For example:
- Step 1: [Describe the initial state and setup based on the problem requirements].
- Step 2: [Explain the logic of the first part of the code and how it manipulates the input].
- ...
- Final Step: [Summarize and present the computed result as the answer, enclosed in the tags].
Example:
- Step 1: [The problem requires sorting a list of integers in descending order. The input list is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5].]
- Step 2: [The canonical solution uses a sorting function. It will rearrange the integers in descending order based on their values.]
- ...
- Final Step: [Output]5, 4, 3, 1, 1[/Output]
