def test_strange_sort_list():
    assert strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    assert strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    assert strange_sort_list([]) == []
    assert strange_sort_list([1]) == [1]
    assert strange_sort_list([1, 2]) == [1, 2]
    assert strange_sort_list([2, 1]) == [2, 1]
    assert strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 3, 2]
    assert strange_sort_list([3, 2, 1]) == [3, 1, 2]
    assert strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
    assert strange_sort_list([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == [5, 1, 3, 2, 4]
```

Please replace 'your_module' with the actual module name where the function `strange_sort_list` is defined.
