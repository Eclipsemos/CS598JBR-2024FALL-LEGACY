If they are equal, the function returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome.\n\nThe function `make_palindrome(string: str) -> str` makes a palindrome from a given string. It does this by appending the reverse of the suffix of the string to the end of the string. The suffix is the part of the string that is not a palindrome.

The prime number check is not correctly implemented in the is_prime function.
